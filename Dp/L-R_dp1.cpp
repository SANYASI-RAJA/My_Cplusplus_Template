// Problem Statement (https://atcoder.jp/contests/dp/tasks/dp_l) :-
// Taro and Jiro will play the following game against each other.Initially, they are given a sequence
// a=(a1,a2,…,aN). Until a becomes empty, the two players perform the following operation alternately,
// starting from Taro:
// Remove the element at the beginning or the end of a. The player earns x points,
// where x is the removed element.
// Let X and Y be Taro's and Jiro's total score at the end of the game,respectively.
// Taro tries to maximize X−Y, while Jiro tries to minimize X−Y.Assuming that the
// two players play optimally, find the resulting value of X−Y.

// Constraints :-
// All values in input are integers.
// 1≤N≤3000
// 1≤a[i]≤10^9

// Explanation:
// Idea is L-R dp
// dp[i][j]= The maximum difference we can attain by considering only numbers
// from index starting from i and terminating at j.
// dp[i][j] can be written as val[i],whenever i and j are equal, because this is the maximum
// difference we can attain after selecting from i to j, whenever i>j dp[i][j]=0, and
// whenever i<j, we can write dp[i][j] as, dp[i][j]=max((val[i]-dp[i+1][j]),(val[j]-dp[i][j-1]))

// code:-

#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define int long long
const int M = 1e9 + 7;
signed main()
{
    int n; cin >> n;
    vector<int>v(n + 1);
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i)
    {
        cin >> v[i];
    }
    vector<vector<int>>dp(n + 1, vector<int>(n + 1));
    for (int i = n; i > 0; --i)
    {
        for (int j = i; j <= n; ++j)
        {
            if (i == j) {
                dp[i][j] = v[i];
            }
            else {
                dp[i][j] = max(v[i] - dp[i + 1][j], v[j] - dp[i][j - 1]);
            }
        }
    }
    cout << dp[1][n];
